Optimism is a belief in a great purpose
underlying the world for good, absolutely certain
to fulfil itself somewhere, somehow.  That must
have been what God saw when He looked upon the
world and called it "good."
</P>

<P>
A hundred men stand on the shore and say: "There
is no land beyond."  One brave and trustful man
like Columbus, believes that the complete world
is complete, and sails for a fair land beyond the
sea, and finds it.
</P>

<P>
Put your faith where it will be safe; and the
only place where a faith ever can be safe is in
the shrine of an action.

he only real way to "prepare to meet thy God" is
to live with thy God so that to meet Him shall be
nothing strange.

<P>
It is not good for a man to devote himself to
preparation for dying.  It is preparation for
living that you need.
</P>

<P>
Our virtue should not be a deed, or a work, but a
growth&mdash;a growth like a tree's, always rising
higher from its own inward strength and sap.
</P>

<P>
The moment that the face is turned away from the
dead past, and looks toward the living future, a
new power comes.  Hope is awake, and hope is
infinite.

elf-restraint and honesty and independence, if
they are the crown upon the head of a benignant
despotism, are the very lifeblood in the veins of
a self-governing republic.

To be calm and serene, and yet to be full of
energy and hope of higher things,&mdash;this comes to
him whose life aims at the absolute.

If you cannot argue, live!  Be true and pure and
lofty and devout, and He who ever seeks the souls
of men shall find His way to some of them through
you.
</P>

<P>
When a man means to be honest solely because
honesty is right, and not because honesty is
profitable, there is a perpetual and beautiful
tendency of his honesty to refine and deepen
itself.
</P>

<P>
Dependence upon God makes the independence of men
in which are liberty and courage.

To every heart's experience comes its time of

You can know nothing which you do not reverence.
